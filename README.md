# hello-world
Well, this is yet another repository!
im supposed to write a bit about myself so idk what to write so im just gonna do this little monologue till im bored, lol.
well, my name is Felin (say it enough times it will start to sound wierd, trust me!) and i like..(cringiest intro ecer, sorry fututre me) trying new things i guess! better try and fail and know that something will not work ranther than wondering if something would work..
Im a proud SLYTHERIN meaning attributes like resourcefulness, cunningness, and ambition are basically second nature to me. Currently my interst is drawn towards the technological side of science so..  who knows how long until that change.
I like BT- nope nope wrong i Love BTS, yup much better. Proud ARMY here!!
and im getting bord of my monologue so this is Scarlet signing off!
